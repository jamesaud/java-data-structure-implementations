1.  a)  ϴ(1) - the maxiumum value in a sorted list will either be the first value in the list or the last
    b)  ϴ(1) - the maxiumum value in a sorted list will either be the first value in the list or the last
    c)  ϴ(n) - run through the list and add all the values ϴ(n) and then divide by the length of the list (constant time or n time, depending on if we have a length/size attribute)
    d)  ϴ(n) or ϴ(1) - if the list's length is known, then we can find the median value lienarly by going to the middle index (or middle 2 indexes and finding the middle) ϴ(1).
		       if the list's length is unknown, it will take ϴ(n) time to count through the list to find the length
    e)  ϴ(n) - Count through the list once, ϴ(n), while storing the counts of the values and return the most appearing number.
